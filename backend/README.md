# Backend (Python) Placeholder

This directory is reserved for the upcoming Python backend. Suggested next steps:

- Choose a framework (FastAPI, Django REST Framework, or Flask) and scaffold it here.
- Expose endpoints for task persistence and history (e.g., `/tasks`, `/sessions`).
- Wire CORS settings to allow the Angular client in `../frontend` during development.
- Add a `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` once dependencies are selected.
